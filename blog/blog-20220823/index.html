  [Rust HTTP client] Ureq
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong>2022-08-23</strong></p>
<p>Ureq is a simple, safe HTTP client.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/algesten/ureq">https://github.com/algesten/ureq</a></p>
<p>Ureq's first priority is being easy for you to use. It's great for anyone who wants a low-overhead HTTP client that just gets the job done. Works very well with HTTP APIs. Its features include cookies, JSON, HTTP proxies, HTTPS, and charset decoding.</p>
<p>Ureq is in pure Rust for safety and ease of understanding. It avoids using unsafe directly. It uses blocking I/O instead of async I/O, because that keeps the API simple and keeps dependencies to a minimum. For TLS, ureq uses rustls or native-tls.</p>
