Ureq is a simple, safe HTTP client.

[https://github.com/algesten/ureq](https://github.com/algesten/ureq)

Ureq's first priority is being easy for you to use. It's great for anyone who wants a low-overhead HTTP client that just gets the job done. Works very well with HTTP APIs. Its features include cookies, JSON, HTTP proxies, HTTPS, and charset decoding.

Ureq is in pure Rust for safety and ease of understanding. It avoids using unsafe directly. It uses blocking I/O instead of async I/O, because that keeps the API simple and keeps dependencies to a minimum. For TLS, ureq uses rustls or native-tls.
