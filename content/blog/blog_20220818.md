### Comparison to sed

While sed does a whole lot more, `sd` focuses on doing just one thing and doing it well.

Some cherry-picked examples, where `sd` shines:

- Simpler syntax for replacing all occurrences:
  - sd: `sd before after`
  - sed: `sed s/before/after/g`
- Replace newlines with commas:
  - sd: `sd '\n' ','`
  - sed: `sed ':a;N;$!ba;s/\n/,/g'`
- Extracting stuff out of strings containing slashes:
  - sd: `echo "sample with /path/" | sd '.*(/.*/)' '$1'`
  - sed: use different delimiters every time depending on expression so that the command is not completely unreadable
    - `echo "sample with /path/" | sed -E 's/.*(\\/.*\\/)/\1/g'`
    - `echo "sample with /path/" | sed -E 's|.*(/.*/)|\1|g'`
- In place modification of files:
  - sd: `sd before after file.txt`
  - sed: you need to remember to use `-e` or else some platforms will consider the next argument to be a backup suffix
    - `sed -i -e 's/before/after/g' file.txt`

### Cargo Installation
```sh
cargo install sd
```

### Quick Guide

1. **String-literal mode**. By default, expressions are treated as regex. Use `-s` or `--string-mode` to disable regex.


```sh
echo 'lots((([]))) of special chars' | sd -s '((([])))' ''
lots of special chars
```

2. **Find & replace in a file**

```sh
sd 'window.fetch' 'fetch' http.js
```

That's it. The file is modified in-place.

To preview changes:

```sh
sd -p 'window.fetch' 'fetch' http.js 
```
3. **Capture groups**

Indexed capture groups:

```sh
echo 'cargo +nightly watch' | sd '(\w+)\s+\+(\w+)\s+(\w+)' 'cmd: $1, channel: $2, subcmd: $3'
cmd: cargo, channel: nightly, subcmd: watch
```

Named capture groups:

```sh
echo "123.45" | sd '(?P<dollars>\d+)\.(?P<cents>\d+)' '$dollars dollars and $cents cents'
123 dollars and 45 cents
```
