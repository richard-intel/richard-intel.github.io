Shuttle is a serverless platform for Rust which makes it really easy to deploy your web-apps.

[https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle](https://github.com/shuttle-hq/shuttle)

Ureq's first priority is being easy for you to use. It's great for anyone who wants a low-overhead HTTP client that just gets the job done. Works very well with HTTP APIs. Its features include cookies, JSON, HTTP proxies, HTTPS, and charset decoding.

Shuttle is built for productivity, reliability and performance:
- Zero-Configuration support for Rust using annotations
- Automatic resource provisioning (databases, caches, subdomains, etc.)
- First-class support for popular Rust frameworks
- Scalable hosting (with optional self-hosting)
