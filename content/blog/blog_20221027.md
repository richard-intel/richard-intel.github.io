Deno is a command runner.

You can install it with cargo:

```sh
cargo install just
```

### Usage
Once `just` is installed and working, create a file named `justfile` in the root of your project with the following contents:

```make
recipe-name:
  echo 'This is a recipe!'

# this is a comment
another-recipe:
  @echo 'This is another recipe.'
```

When you invoke `just` it looks for file `justfile` in the current directory and upwards, so you can invoke it from any subdirectory of your project.

The search for a `justfile` is case insensitive, so any case, like `Justfile`, `JUSTFILE`, or `JuStFiLe`, will work. `just` will also look for files with the name `.justfile`, in case you'd like to hide a `justfile`.

Running `just` with no arguments runs the first recipe in the `justfile`:

```sh
$ just
echo 'This is a recipe!'
This is a recipe!
```

One or more arguments specify the recipe(s) to run:

```sh
$ just another-recipe
This is another recipe.
```

`just` prints each command to standard error before running it, which is why `echo 'This is a recipe!'` was printed. This is suppressed for lines starting with `@`, which is why `echo 'This is another recipe.'` was not printed.

Recipes stop running if a command fails. Here `cargo publish` will only run if `cargo test` succeeds:

```make
publish:
  cargo test
  # tests passed, time to publish!
  cargo publish
```
